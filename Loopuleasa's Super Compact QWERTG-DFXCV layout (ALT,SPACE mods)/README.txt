Dota 2 keyboard layout by 1gn1t0r
Forked from https://github.com/loopuleasa/super-compact-dota2-keybinds
----------------------------------

This keyboard layout is what I currently use and I'm constantly tweaking it until I get an optimal layout.
Each file has a role, and modify what you want in it.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	Autoexec engine
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- autoexec.cfg

Manages the core functionality of the other files. It's loaded automatically by dota2. 



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	dota2_gameplay_mode folder
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains all the .cfg files that are loaded
and they control the game settings and binds as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------

- dota2_functions_active.cfg

This file holds all the aliases and custom defined functions made by the use.


- dota2_keybinds_default.cfg
- dota2_keybinds_space_pressed.cfg
- dota2_keybinds_alt_pressed.cfg

These three files are full of "bind" commands which connect one key on your keyboard to a function or command.
Each one of them is responsible for setting the keybinds for either default mode (no ALT or SPACE key pressed), alt mode (ALT+Key) or space mode (SPACE+Key).
Basically, when you press ALT, the keys from dota2_keybinds_alt_pressed are active, and when SPACE is pressed, the keys from dota2_keybinds_space_pressed are active.


- dota2_settings_game.cfg

This file contains all the game tweaks and settings (minimap, camera, various toggles, and many options related directly to the game)


- dota2_settings_tech.cfg

This file contains all the graphical, visual and technical options that are more related to the computer that is running dota2 and not the game itself.



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	dota2_hero_custom_configs folder
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------
Inside this folder, you will have hero custom configs that 
you can load by typing a command in the console. 
They're used to add custom keybinds that were designed 
specifically for a single hero. 
Check the readme inside the folder on how to use them.
